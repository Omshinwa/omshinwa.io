# super-chess
a chess AI in javascript using chess.js and chessboard.js

check https://omshinwa.github.io/super-chess/

implemented:

alpha beta, quiescence search (with stactic exchange evaluation), transposition tables (i think it works well? lol), iterative deepening.

gotta add: killer and history euristics.

chess.js move generation is quite slow (i think it's because it doesn't have pieces arrays), maybe i'll have to do my own board representation...
